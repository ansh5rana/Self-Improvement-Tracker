# Self-Improvement-Tracker

This project is an innovative self-improvement tracker designed to help users monitor their daily activities, set and achieve long-term goals, and generate insightful reports to foster personal growth. The application leverages cutting-edge technologies in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to provide a personalized self-improvement experience.

Users can input their daily activities, challenges faced, and positive moments through an intuitive interface. The tracker then utilizes this information to generate comprehensive reports that not only summarize the user's day but also offer tailored insights and encouragement. A separate page allows users to define and update their long-term goals, which are seamlessly integrated into the personalized advice provided in the reports. The application also features a dedicated page where users can review their past reports, enabling them to track their progress and see how the tracker has positively impacted their journey towards self-improvement.

Built on a powerful tech stack, the Self-Improvement-Tracker combines Streamlit for a clean, interactive front-end with ChromaDB, a state-of-the-art vector database, for efficient data storage and retrieval. The heart of the application lies in its integration with OpenAI's state of the art Large Language Models (LLM) through the LangChain library. This integration allows for the generation of highly personalized reports based on the user's inputs and goals. The application employs a custom prompt template to ensure that the LLM provides relevant, encouraging, and actionable insights. All user inputs, goals, and generated reports are securely stored in the ChromaDB vector database, allowing for quick retrieval and analysis. This thoughtful combination of technologies results in a seamless, responsive, and intelligent self-improvement tool that adapts to each user's unique journey.
